# Understanding JavaScript Closures

Closures are a fundamental concept in JavaScript. They allow functions to access variables from an enclosing scope, even after that scope has finished executing.

## How Closures Work

A closure is created when a function is defined inside another function, allowing the inner function to access the outer function's variables.

```javascript
function outerFunction() {
  const outerVariable = 'I am outside!';

  function innerFunction() {
    console.log(outerVariable);
  }

  return innerFunction;
}

const closure = outerFunction();
closure(); // Output: I am outside!
```

## Conclusion

Closures are a powerful feature in JavaScript, enabling more flexible and modular code. Understanding them is key to mastering JavaScript.
