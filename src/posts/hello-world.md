# Hello World!

Welcome to my new blog built with SvelteKit and Markdown. This is a sample post to demonstrate how the blog works.

## Features

This blog includes several features:

- **Markdown Support**: Write posts in Markdown format
- **Responsive Design**: Looks great on all devices
- **Minimalist Theme**: Clean and simple design
- **Social Sharing**: Share posts on social media
- **Analytics**: Track page views with Umami

## Code Example

Here's a simple code example:

```js
// Regular function
function greet(name) {
  return "Hello, " + name + "!";
}

// Using template literal
const greetTemplate = (name) => `Hello, ${name}!`;

console.log(greet('World'));
console.log(greetTemplate('World'));
```

## What's Next?

I'll be posting more content soon. Stay tuned!
